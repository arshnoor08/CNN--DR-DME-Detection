# CNN--DR-DME-Detection

Project: The manual diagnosis process of DR and DME retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time consuming and prone to misdiagnosis. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the severity of the Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema. 

Model Architecture Information: InceptionResNetV2

Dataset used: Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD)
This dataset was available as a part of "Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation and Grading Challenge" organised in conjunction with IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI-2018), Washington D.C.

Fundus Camera Specifications:
All of the images were taken with a Kowa VX-10 alpha digital fundus camera, which has a 50-degree field of view (FOV) and is centred near the macula. The photos, which are roughly 800KB in size, are in the jpg file format and have a resolution of 4288Ã—2848 pixels.
